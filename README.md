# CKEditor 4 WYSIWYG editor Vue component
The official [CKEditor 4](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/) WYSIWYG editor component for Vue.

## Quick start

In order to create an editor instance in Vue, install the `ckeditor4-vue` npm package as a dependency of your project:

```bash
npm install --save ckeditor4-vue
```

Include the `<script>` tags for the WYSIWYG editor component and the build:

```html
<script src="../node_modules/@ckeditor/ckeditor4-vue/dist/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Enable the component in your application by using the `Vue.use()` method:

```js
Vue.use( CKEditor );
```

Use the `<ckeditor>` component in your template:

- The `v-model` attribute enables an out–of–the–box two–way data binding.
- The `config` attribute lets you pass the configuration to the editor instance.
