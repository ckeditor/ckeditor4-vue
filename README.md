## Installation and usage

To install the CKEditor 4 component for Vue.js from npm, simply run:

```
npm install ckeditor4-vue
```

Then use it by calling the `Vue.use()` method:

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import CKEditor from 'ckeditor4-vue';

Vue.use( CKEditor );

new Vue( {
	// ... options
} )
```

And use the `<ckeditor />` component in your template:

```html
<template>
	<div id="app">
		<ckeditor value="Hello, World!"></ckeditor>
	</div>
</template>
```

Instead of using ES6 imports, the component can also be added via a direct script include:

```html
<script src="../node_modules/ckeditor4-vue/dist/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

and used in the same way as with ES6 imports:

```js
Vue.use( CKEditor );
```

Refer to the official [CKEditor 4 Vue component documentation](http://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_vue.html#basic-usage) for more information about the installation process.

## Documentation and examples

See the [CKEditor 4 WYSIWYG Editor Vue Integration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_vue.html) article in the [CKEditor 4 documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest).

You can also check out the [CKEditor 4 WYSIWYG Editor Vue Integration samples](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/examples/vue.html) in [CKEditor 4 Examples](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/examples/).

## Browser support

The CKEditor 4 Vue component works with all the [supported browsers](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_browsers.html#officially-supported-browsers) except for Internet Explorer.

To enable Internet Explorer 11 support, instead of the standard import you need to import a specific `dist/legacy.js` file containing all required polyfills:

```js
import CKEditor from 'ckeditor4-vue/dist/legacy.js'
```

**Note**: Even though CKEditor 4 supports older Internet Explorer versions including IE8, IE9 and IE10, the Vue integration is only supported in the latest Internet Explorer 11.
